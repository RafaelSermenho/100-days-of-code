# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 30, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Updated versions, include code to download picture and trigger media scan.

**Thoughts:** I really need to refactor this code. I struggled with outdated versions and realized that the architecture I was following really sucks. For a first day, it's good.

** What's next: ** Create a MVP architecture, include data binding, refactor the code, finish settings screen.
