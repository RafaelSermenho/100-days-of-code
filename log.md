# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 30, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Updated versions, include code to download picture and trigger media scan.

**Thoughts:** I really need to refactor this code. I struggled with outdated versions and realized that the architecture I was following really sucks. For a first day, it's good.

**What's next:** Create a MVP pattern, include data binding, refactor the code, finish settings screen.

### Day 2: January 31, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Refactor some code, remove eventbus and begin implementation of MVP pattern.

**Thoughts:** Today was a good dev night! I was able to change some code that was bothering me and finally could see some MVP in real project.

**What's next:** Continue the MVP pattern, include data binding, finish settings screen.
