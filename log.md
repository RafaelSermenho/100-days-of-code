# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 30, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Updated versions, include code to download picture and trigger media scan.

**Thoughts:** I really need to refactor this code. I struggled with outdated versions and realized that the architecture I was following really sucks. For a first day, it's good.

**What's next:** Create a MVP pattern, include data binding, refactor the code, finish settings screen.

### Day 3: February 01, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Refactor some code, fixed some lint warnings and findbugs issues. Also started working on settings screen. (Code is on branch new_architecture)

**Thoughts:** Today was not very productive and I spent almost one hour trying to figure out how to start and activity through sharedPreferences. The refactor, lint warnings and findbugs were ok.

**What's next:** finish settings screen and shared preference code and study JobScheduler.

### Day 7: February 06, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a PoC of JobScheduler in a new repository.

**Thoughts:** This example is very simple, but it was very useful to clarify my ideas for my other app (Nasa - Picture Of The Day).

### Day 9: February 08, 2017
